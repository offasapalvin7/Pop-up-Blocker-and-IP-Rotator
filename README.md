This extension has a browser action that allows the user to toggle the pop-up blocker on and off. When the pop-up blocker is enabled, the extension uses the webRequest API to block pop-up requests. The extension also rotates the IP address using the fetch API and a IP address API, with the interval between rotations determined by the ipRotationInterval constant.

To use this extension, save it to a file (e.g. "Poprotate.js.js") and load it into Google Chrome as an unpacked extension. For more information on how to do this, see the Google Chrome documentation on loading unpacked extensions.
